All services provided by Developer to you by means of your use of the booking channel, for booking purposes, are hereinafter referred to as the “Service”.</p>
					
					<h4>AGREEMENT BETWEEN DEVELOPER AND YOU</h4>

					<p>The service allows you to create a network of friends, from your contact list to share the Cab or any other mode of transportation.
