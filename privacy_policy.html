                            <p>The Application offers information and a means to share transportation services offered by third party service providers, drivers or vehicle operators (the “Cab”), which may be requested through phone via call centre, Website, the use of an application supplied by Developer and downloaded and installed by you on your single mobile device (smart phone) (the&nbsp;“Application”) or through any other channel made available by Developer for ‘booking’ purposes. All services provided by Developer to you by means of your use of the booking channel, for booking purposes, are hereinafter referred to as the “Service”.</p>

                            <strong>AGREEMENT BETWEEN DEVELOPER AND YOU</strong>

                            <p>By using the Service, you enter into a contract with Developer (the&nbsp;“Contract”).

                            <strong>HOW TO USE THE SERVICE</strong>

                            <p>The service allows you to create a network of friends, from your contact list to share the Cab or any other mode of transportation. Only those friends or persons, who have the Application downloaded on their mobile device, can appear on your network and avail of the service. You may send Invitation to friends through the Application to join your network by downloading the Application.</p>

                            <p>You may also select, through the Application, a Cab which is available and authorized to provide the transportation services in the territory, and thereafter share the same with people or users of the Application in your network. The Cab has sole and complete discretion to accept or reject each request for service.</p>

                            <p>Developer shall bring you into contact with a Cab in order to obtain transportation service, by facilitating booking of the Cab directly through the API(Application Processing Interface) provided by the Cab, linking you to the online service of such Cab or by providing the required contact details.
